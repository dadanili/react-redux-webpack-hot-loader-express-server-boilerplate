# React app with redux and node server using Webpack, Webpack Hotloader, and Babel

##Benefit

Hotloader allows developer to make changes to any file and have them reflected immediately without having to reload


##Usage

git clone https://github.com/dadanili/react-webpack-hotloader-nodeserver-boilerplate.git
cd react-webpack-hotloader-nodeserver-boilerplate
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000

##Note
server file is in server folder 
current setup uses Redux. To continue using Redux, make reducers and add them to combineReducers in index.jsx file in src/  app folder
